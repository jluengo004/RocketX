# RocketX
Initial version was thought to be a list of rockets that would show a detailed view when clicked in a specific rocket. Since the amout of rockets was small that was modified to a Slider.

When pressing twice in a rocket image a gallery of that rocket is shown. In that gallery, when pressing a photo, that photo will move to the large view of the gallery.

Automatized Tests:
In the terminal execute "fastlane tests" for all the tests to run. A folter "test_output" will be created with "index.html" inside, which shows the test coverage.

To-Do:
    - Securize code when unwrapping
    - Tests + Automatic test and coverage with fastlane
    - Appicon without blank background
